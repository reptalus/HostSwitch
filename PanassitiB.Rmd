I am a quantitative ecologist connecting ecological big data and statistical models. My main research interest concerns the development of habitat models to identify and quantify environmental factors causing the observed spatial pattern of species or diseases. Combining bio-monitoring, and statistical models, I study insect diversity in Bavarian grasslands. Results shall provide more ecological insight on how to optimize agro-environmental actions to obtain more species-rich grasslands.
