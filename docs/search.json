While the prevalent paradigm wants the cospeciation to be the main process driving the coevolution of most of the biological associations, recent evidence showed that host-switching, favored by the intrinsic capability of adaptation in the sub-optimal environment, may explain rapid novel associations (i.e. colonization of novel hosts at the ecological time scale) eventually followed by speciation (at the evolutionary time) as well the observed incongruences of the paired phylogenies (see (Brooks, Hoberg, and Boeger 2019) for a review).",

      "description": "The ‘HostSwitch’ package uses an individual-based model to simulate dispersion and host switch events by a consumer. As a consequence to the adaptation to a new resource, the consumer may expand its host range. The HostSwitch R package provides functions to explore host switch events on a novel resource over the time. Based on the Individual-Based Model (IBM) published in Araujo et al. (2015), the main function of this R package simulates the colonization dynamics of consumers over resources that are randomly offered. The HostSwitch package was implemented by including all functionalities in the original IBM model as well as numerous additions, such as comparison and evaluation of simulations with several customized parameter options and an in-depth description of the parameters in an ecological context.

My research\r\n              focuses on the understanding of the processes driving\r\n              interacting species and the maintenance of biodiversity in\r\n              ecological communities. My work ranges from field studies\r\n              of the ecological theory of species associations to\r\n              fundamental studies of the evolution of host-pathogen\r\n              systems. In particular, I use the interactions among\r\n              phytoplasmas, Auchenorrhyncha and their plant hosts as a\r\n              biological model to pursues broadly conceptual research in\r\n              ‘natural’ and managed ecosystems.\r\n              Education\r\n              University of Neuchâtel | Switzerland\r\n              Ph.D. in Biology | April 2012 - April 2016University of Pisa | Italy\r\n              M.S. in Environmental Sciences | September 1997 - April\r\n              2003\r\n              Experience Since\r\n              2018, she works at the Illinois Natural History Survey,\r\n              University of Illinois (US) as postdoctoral fellow after\r\n              working as a research assistant at Federal Institute for\r\n              Forest Snow and Landscape Research WSL and Agroscope in\r\n              Switzerland.\r\n            \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    ",
