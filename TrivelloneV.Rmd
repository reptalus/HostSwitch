I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate studying ecology and evolutionary biology of host-pathogen associations at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on the understanding of the processes driving interacting species and the maintenance of biodiversity in ecological communities.
My work ranges from field studies of the ecological theory of species associations to fundamental studies of the evolution of host-pathogen systems. In particular, I use the interactions among phytoplasmas, Auchenorrhyncha and
their plant hosts as a biological model to pursues broadly conceptual research in ‘natural’ and managed ecosystems.
